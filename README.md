Advanced Machine Learning Analysis of Radiation Hardening in Reduced-Activation Ferritic/Martensitic Steels
Authors
Pengxin Wang, G. M. A. M. El-Fallah

Overview
This repository contains the machine learning analysis and related code for studying the radiation hardening of Reduced Activation Ferritic-Martensitic (RAFM) steel. The work aims to develop predictive models to better understand and mitigate the effects of radiation-induced hardening in advanced materials.
